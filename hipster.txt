You can’t have great software without a great team, and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families. (Jim McCarthy) That’s the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is lousy programmers. (Larry Niven) Programmers are in a race with the Universe to create bigger and better idiot-proof programs, while the Universe is trying to create bigger and better idiots. So far the Universe is winning. (Rich Cook) Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight. (Bill Gates)
