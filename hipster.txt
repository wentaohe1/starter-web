You can’t have great software without a great team, and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families. (Jim McCarthy) That’s the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is lousy programmers. (Larry Niven) Programmers are in a race with the Universe to create bigger and better idiot-proof programs, while the Universe is trying to create bigger and better idiots. So far the Universe is winning. (Rich Cook) Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight. (Bill Gates)

A great lathe operator commands several times the wage of an average lathe operator, but a great writer of software code is worth 10,000 times the price of an average software writer. (Bill Gates) Software suppliers are trying to make their software packages more ‘user-friendly’… Their best approach so far has been to take all the old brochures and stamp the words ‘user-friendly’ on the cover. (Bill Gates) First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. (John Johnson) We are Microsoft. Resistance Is Futile. You Will Be Assimilated. (Bumper sticker) The best performance improvement is the transition from the nonworking state to the working state. (J. Osterhout)

Don’t worry if it doesn’t work right. If everything did, you’d be out of a job. (Mosher’s Law of Software Engineering) I don’t care if it works on your machine! We are not shipping your machine! (Vidiu Platon) Every operating system out there is about equal… We all suck. (Microsoft senior vice president Brian Valentine describing the state of the art in OS security, 2003) Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer. There are three, of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris. (Larry Wall) It would appear that we have reached the limits of what it is possible to achieve with computer technology, although one should be careful with such statements, as they tend to sound pretty silly in 5 years. (John Von Neumann, circa 1949)
